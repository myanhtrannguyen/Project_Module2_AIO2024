# Project_Image_Retrieval
- Image Retrieval is a problem within the field of Information Retrieval. The task involves developing a program that returns images related to an input query image, with the images being retrieved from a given image dataset. Currently, there are several image retrieval applications such as Google Image Search, the product search function using images on Shopee, Lazada, Tiki, and others.
The Input/Output of a text retrieval system includes:
• Input: Query Image and Images Library.
• Output: A list of images similar to the query image.
- In this project, we will build an image retrieval system using a pre-trained deep learning model (CLIP) to extract image features and obtain feature vectors. We will then use a vector database to index, store, and retrieve images similar to the requested image through similarity measurement algorithms.
- This project will introduce methods from basic to advanced for building an image retrieval system. We will develop this system on a specific dataset. Next, the project will proceed with data collection and processing to create a personalized image retrieval system for each user (optional). The main goals of the project include:
• Building a basic image retrieval program.
• Developing an advanced image retrieval program using the CLIP model and a vector database.
• Collecting and processing data to build a personalized image retrieval program.
