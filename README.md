# Project_Text_Classification
1. Text Classification is one of the common problems in the field of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. The task involves building a program capable of classifying text into predefined categories. Common applications related to this type of program include detecting negative comments on the internet, positive product reviews, and more.

2. In this project, we will build a Text Classification program related to classifying whether a message is spam or not, using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The Input/Output of the program includes:
   
• Input: A text message.

• Output: Whether the message is spam or not (boolean).
